# Function which checks for erroneous input(s) for Aperture(s), Exposure Time(s) and Active Channels and returns the appropriate exception

def SanityChecks(my_list1, my_list2, my_list3):
	"""
	This function performs sanity checks on the provided lists.

	Parameters:
		my_list1 (list): A list of strings representing whether a channel is active or not. The string should be 'Yes' or 'No'.
		my_list2 (list): A list of integers representing the aperture of the corresponding channel in my_list1.
		my_list3 (list): A list of integers representing the exposure time of the corresponding channel in my_list1.

	Returns:
		None

	Raises:
		ValueError: If aperture or exposure time is not as expected for the corresponding active/non-active channel.
